## Introduction

This is a robust Minesweeper implementation written in Rust, designed for the Terminal environment. Built with TUI (Text User Interface) framework, it brings the nostalgic puzzle experience directly to your command line.


- Authentic Recreation: A near-perfect replica of the classic Windows Minesweeper, faithfully preserving the original mechanics, logic, and difficulty levels.
​
- TUI Graphics: Utilizes advanced terminal manipulation to deliver a clean, responsive, and visually appealing text-based interface.
​
- Classic Gameplay: Includes all the essential features you remember—left-click to reveal, right-click to flag, and "chording" (double-click) to clear areas quickly.
